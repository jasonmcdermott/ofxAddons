#OFXGLWARPER
###openGL based image warper add-on
Based on the openGL image warper example by Theo Watson.

####Features
* Quad-Warp anything that's being drawn in OF.
* begin() and end() methods to define the warpped elements.
* Easy quad manipulation by draging the quad corners with the mouse.
* Get screen-to-warpped-coordinates and warpped-to-screen-coordinates methods.
* Setup now requires the resolution of the screen to be passed making it much more flexible.
